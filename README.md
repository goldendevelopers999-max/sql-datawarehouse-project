# SQL Data Warehouse Project

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project** repository! 🚀  
This project demonstrates a comprehensive data warehousing and analytics solution, from building a data warehouse to generating actionable insights.

---
## 📖 Project Overview

This project involves:

1. **Data Architecture**: Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers.
2. **ETL Pipelines**: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
3. **Data Modeling**: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
4. **Analytics & Reporting**: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.


## 🚀 Project Requirements

### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

#### Objective
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

#### Specifications
- **Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
- **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
- **Integration**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
- **Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
- **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.

### BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analysis)

#### Objective
Develop SQL-based analytics to deliver detailed insights into:
- **Customer Behavior**
- **Product Performance**
- **Sales Trends**

## 🏗️ Data Architecture

The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers:
![Data Architecture](docs/data_architecture.png)

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

## Data integration 
To understand the data integration between the different tables and see the relations bettween them, the following integration architecture shows that:

## Data modeling 

After creating the bronze layer which hosts the raw data and then the silver layer in which we did data transformation, in the gold layer the data is modelled according to the star schema having a fact table and dimensions.

The data model is like the following:

 The data flow is explained in the following graph:
